    "# Trait Simulation - Ordinal Multinomial Power\n",
    "\n",
    "Authors: Sarah Ji, Janet Sinsheimer, Kenneth Lange, Hua Zhou\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show how to use the `TraitSimulation.jl` package we illustrate how TraitSimulation.jl can easily simulate traits from genotype data, all within the OpenMendel universe. Operating within this universe brings potential advantages over the available software(s) when needed for downstream analysis or study design. Using just a few calls on the command line to the appropriate packages within the OpenMendel, we demonstrate how to use the OpenMendel code pipeline to construct the genetic model, simulate the trait and find the power for the Ordinal Multinomial Trait. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinal multinomial model is a powerful way to model stages of disease progression. For a disease like diabetes, the monitoring of the disease's progression may be improved based on several different biomarkers detected in the EHR data, such as diabetes diagnostic codes, diabetes medication, hyperglycemia in blood results defined by HbA1c and fasting glucose levels, and presence of diabetes process of care codes. Then these algorithm can better categorize individuals into disease progression categories that relate to how likely they are to have diabetes. This is motivated by the need for early diagnoses and effective intervention techniques. For a detailed review on the published ordinal model, we provide in the references our most recent published paper in Genetic Epidemiology, [Ordered multinomial regression for genetic association analysis of ordinal phenotypes at Biobank scale](https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22276)\n",
    "\n",
    "This software package, TraitSimuliation.jl addresses the need for simulated trait data in genetic analyses.  This package generates data sets that will allow researchers to accurately check the validity of programs and to calculate power for their proposed studies. This package gives users the ability to easily simulate phenotypic traits under generalized linear models (GLMs) or variance component models (VCMs) conditional on PLINK formatted genotype data [3]. In addition, we demo customized simulation utilities that accompany specific genetic analysis options in Open-Mendel; for example, ordered, multinomial traits. We demonstrate these simulation utilities on the example dataset described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in this demo is restricted to a subset of individuals of European ancestry excluding first- and second-degree relatives based off of kinship estimates. We filtered samples by 98% genotyping success rate on all chromosomes and SNPs by 99% genotyping success rate. These measures result in n = 185,565 individuals and 470,228 SNPs for analysis. A more detailed description of the data can be found in the references [3](https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22276) The data from this notebook can be found in the UK Biobank repository under Project ID: 48152 and 15678 at https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk with the permission of UK Biobank. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the OpenMendel package [SnpArrays.jl](https://openmendel.github.io/SnpArrays.jl/latest/) to both read in and write out PLINK formatted files. "

    "# Reading genotype data using SnpArrays\n",
    "\n",
    "First use `SnpArrays.jl` to read in the genotype data. We use PLINK formatted data with the same prefixes for the .bim, .fam, .bed files.\n",
    "\n",
    "SnpArrays is a very useful utility and can do a lot more than just read in the data. More information about all the functionality of SnpArrays can be found at:\n",
    "https://openmendel.github.io/SnpArrays.jl/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "As missing genotypes are often due to problems making the calls, the called genotypes at a marker with too much missing genotypes are potentially unreliable. By default, SnpArrays filters to keep only the genotypes with success rates greater than 0.98 and the minimum minor allele frequency to be 0.01. If the user wishes to change the stringency, change the number given in filter according to [SnpArrays](https://openmendel.github.io/SnpArrays.jl/latest/#Fitering-1)."
