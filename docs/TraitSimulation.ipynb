    "# Trait Simulation Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Authors: Sarah Ji, Janet Sinsheimer, Kenneth Lange\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show how to use the `TraitSimulation.jl` package we illustrate how TraitSimulation.jl can easily simulate traits from genotype data, all within the OpenMendel universe. Operating within this universe brings potential advantages over the available software(s) when needed for downstream analysis or study design. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using just a few calls on the command line to the appropriate packages within the OpenMendel, we demonstrate in three easy examples the utilities of the TraitSimulation.jl package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lack of software available to geneticists who wish to calculate power and sample sizes in designing a study on genetics data. Typically, the study power depends on assumptions about the underlying disease model.  Many power calculating software tools operate as a black box and do not allow for customization.  To develop custom tests, researchers can develop their own simulation procedures to carry out power calculations.  One limitation with many existing methods for simulating traits conditional on genotypes is that these methods are limited to normally distributed traits and to fixed effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This software package, TraitSimuliation.jl addresses the need for simulated trait data in genetic analyses.  This package generates data sets that will allow researchers to accurately check the validity of programs and to calculate power for their proposed studies. This package gives users the ability to easily simulate phenotypic traits under GLMs or LMMs conditional on PLINK formatted genotype data [3]. In addition, we include customized simulation utilities that accompany specific genetic analysis options in Open-Mendel; for example, ordered, multinomial traits. We demonstrate these simulation utilities on the example dataset described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the OpenMendel package [SnpArrays.jl](https://openmendel.github.io/SnpArrays.jl/latest/) to both read in and write out PLINK formatted files. Available in the data directory under the [Example_Data](https://openmendel.github.io/SnpArrays.jl/latest/#Example-data-1) section of this package, we use the file `\"EUR_SUBSET\"` for the demonstration how to simulate phenotypic traits on PLINK formatted data. \n",
    "For convenience we use the common assumption that the residual covariance among two relatives can be captured by the additive genetic variance times twice the kinship coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each example the user can specify the simulation model parameters, along with the number of repitions for each simulation model as desired. By default, the simulation will return the result of a single simulation.\n"
